# codedis-backend

What is **codedis**? I still don't know yet, but i'm sure it will be good in the future

How to run this thing?

- Run `yarn`, it's recommended to use yarn instead of npm
- Run `cp .env.example .env` and setup the environment variable
- Run `yarn start` to run a development server
- Run `yarn build` to build the server
- Please note to serve the `build` folder instead of the `src` folder
